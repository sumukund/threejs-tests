# Three.js Tech Share Demo



Three.js is an open source Javascript library that makes creating and displaying 3D graphics and animations on the web browser easier using WebGL (Web Graphics Library). Without Three.js, you'd have to use WebGL code (which is low-level) to draw simple 3D shapes like points, lines, and triangles. Three.js handles all that complexity for you so you can focus on creativity such as lighting, animation, and complex 3D math.
